							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Blockchain technology has revolutionized workflows and processors cross many different industries. 
								Initially gaining popularity as a secure mechanism for peer-to-peer transaction as introduced by 
								Satoshi Nakamoto, blockchain technology has now evolved to have extensive applications in numerous 
								industries. </p>

							<p>Cryptocurrency was what first got me interested in blockchain technology. 
								After I purchased my first Ethereum coin using Coinhako in early 2020, 
								I was intrigued to learn how Ethereum works, and the problems that it solves. 
								After gaining more understanding about the different cryptocurrencies in the market, 
								I started purchasing other cryptocurrencies such as XRP and ADA. I was amazed at the sheer 
								number of cryptocurrencies in the market and the respective blockchains that they operate on.
							</p>

                            <p>I was also particularly intrigued at how smart contracts operate on the blockchain and its 
								various use cases. I recently undertook an online course offered by the university of Buffalo 
								to gain a deeper understanding of smart contracts in Ethereum and to have a go at Solidity. 
								I hope to be able to explore this are of interest deeper and understand how smart contracts 
								operate on other blockchains as well.
