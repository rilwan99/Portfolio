							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>It was my first time building a website and I had to self-learn HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
								But the most challenging task that I faced was learning how to use the ReactJS framework.
								The concept of components and hooks seemed very complex to me and I struggled to learn them
							</p>

							<p>After much time spent learning ReactJS through online courses- mainly CodeWithMosh, I became 
								more familiar and had a better understanding of the key concepts of ReactJS. Here comes the 
								next challenge- integrating a backend framework.
							</p>

							<p>My partner and I decided to use Google firestore due to its scalabiliy and ease. We 
								utilised google authentication to let users sign in using their email or social account. 
								Following which, we created a forum component for our website and utilised cloud firestore as a database 
								store and retrieve data from users' posts.
							</p>

							<p>In hindsight, some of the things that we could have done better include coming up with a 
								more detailed plan of the features that we wanted to create as well as the tech stack required
								to make these features work.
							</p>

							<p>Our website can be found <a href="https://orbital-github.vercel.app/" >here</a>. 
								Do give it a look!
